# The infinite mixture of Gaussians -- With the explicit sampling of the mixing distribution

We generate finite mixture of Gaussians and sample the posterior with the mixing distribution DP distributed. 

Note: Instead of using the Chinese restuants process, we sample the posterior of the mixiing measure explicitly.

## Functions included:

1. data_generate: Generate a mixing measure and the observations according the mixing measure.

2. dp_post: Sample the posterior of the mixing measure and the latent variables.

## Scripts included:

1. main: An example of the repo.

## Figures included:

1. data_hist: The histogram of the generated observations.

2. mixing: The theoretical and the sampled mixing measures.
